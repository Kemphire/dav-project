# Our Solution to the above objectives respectively

## General things

##### To analyse the amount of developers from India Participating in this survery

For this we've plotted a bar plot, by groupping on the basis of age group and then plotting it against the count of devs in that particular age group

##### To analyse the proffession, interest and background of those developers

After our analysis on this particular objective we found the following

>[!INFO]
> There a **2830** devs who are employed in some or other manner
> There are **935** students in Indian developers community
> There are **127** students who are employed in some or other manner

and gernerated the following the box-plot regarding the componsation distribution of Indian devs

and discovered thiese stats

>[!Info]
> Average compensation of Indian devs is **48921930380.79304**
> Median compensation of Indian devs is **1300000.0**
